# Other Grad School Options
**Roughly in order of the ones I recommend**


[University of Tennessee Chattanooga](https://www.utc.edu/engineering-and-computer-science/academic-programs/computer-science-and-engineering/masters-and-phd-programs/admission)
- Advantage is that there are no strict course requirements for admission, so may be easier to get a "conditional acceptance" (which would help for your student visa)
- Another advantage is that cost of living is much lower in Chattanooga 
- This also looks like a pretty damn good program(#26 in best online masters in CS programs, and #15 in most affordable online programs)
- I can't tell if it's totally online, but would be easy to call and find out

  
[University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions/graduate-admission-requirements/)
- The Kahlert School of Computing does not require students to have a computer science bachelor’s degree. However, students need to have significant coding and computer science experience in order to be admitted and succeed in our graduate programs
- So, no formal course requirement, so could be easier to get a "conditional approval" if we can understand what they mean by "significant coding and computer science experience"


[CO School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/msdegree/)
- [Admissions](https://catalog.mines.edu/graduate/programs/cs/#majortext)
- Only like 5 prerequisite courses, so could be a very good option
- You have to take the GRE, which could be very challening


[University of Tennessee](https://onlinemscs.utk.edu/program/)
- This is definitely a great program, but it looks like it may have admissions requirements that are very hard to meet 
- If you are open to an online degree, could open up a lot more options


## Next Steps
- So I think regardless of which grad school you go to, you will need to complete the intro CS courses from Denver or Aurora Community College
- Which if these you take is up to you. You may be able to skip one of the courses in at Denver Community if you take a math test, but honestly, the prerequisite CS course could be very helpful for you
- I will need to email University of Denver and confirm that these courses count 
- When choosing between Aurora and Denver community college, worth considering if one offers night classes, summer classes, if one fits your schedule better, if one is cheaper, etc
