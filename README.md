# Programming Resources for Elo
Just setting this space up so I can periodically drop some helpful resources as I come across them!

Ok so, I'm going to make a few assumptions here
- You're interested in learning to program so that you can find a job. Consequently, you are interested in learning whatever will give you the highest chance of landing a job
- Generally, it is easier to find a job as a "Front End" developer (citation needed). This basically means you would be learning to build the "User Interfaces" for websites (the stuff that people see and interact with)
- Based on the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology) from this year, the top languages are JavaScript and HTML/CSS, these three are often referred to as the "building blocks of the web", since _every_ website is built with them (to some extent)
- Even though these are used in every website, most people don't work with them directly. Instead, people work with "frameworks". You can think of these as a layer on top of these technologies that makes them easier to work with, and makes it easier to build complex stuff with these technologies. By far, the most popular framework for building websites is React
- With this, a general learning path would be something like: learn some basic programming concepts -> learn how to build simple websites with HTML/CSS/JS -> learn how to build more complex webistes with React (I'll expand much more on this later)


## Learning Path 
- [HTML Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&t=2437s), [CSS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI), and [JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c). This channel is awesome, and very beginner friendly as far as I can tell. After working through these courses, you should be able to build a really simple website. I would highly reccomend doing this before consuming more content so you can apply what you've learned
- [Web Development 2023 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u72H_zZzkcw). From the same channel as the videos above. This isn't a tutorial, it just gives you an overview of all the technologies in the "Web Development" space, as well as some of the big concepts (such as Frontend vs Backend development). This should just help familiarize you with the space. 


## Important Documentation
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - contains docs for [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [React Docs](https://react.dev/). These are incredible, and are _the_ place to go for learning when you do start learning React

## Random Advice
- **Don't get stuck in "tutorial hell".** That is, do not get caught in the trap of thinking you need to learn more before you are actualy able to build something. Each time you learn something, try to actually apply that thing by building something with it. Even if you can't get it to work, you will learn so much more by actually trying to creating something
- **Keep track of the things you build.** GitHub (the website we are on now) is the place you should store the things you build on. GitHub is used at pretty much every single company you would think about getting a job at. You can think about it as a place to store your code. I'll drop some more resources in here about learning to work with it.
- **Read! The! Docs!** Every language, framework, and piece of technology you work with will have some "documentation". This means, whoever built that technology took the time to write a ton of information about it, such as what it was built for, best practices for working with it, and often, examples of how to use it. When you are working on something and run into any problem or confusion, the first place to look should be the documentation for that particular language/framework/package/whatever
- **Have Fun!** As hard as this field can be, it's pretty amazing that we live in a time where there are basically unlimited resources that can help you build virtually anything you want to on the web. Take advantage of this, and remember to have fun building stuff :)
